# Neurodiversity Celebration Week 2023 at Advancing Analytics
Neurodiversity Celebration Week is an annual event that promotes awareness and acceptance of neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and Tourette's syndrome. This week-long celebration aims to highlight the unique strengths and abilities of neurodivergent individuals, while challenging stigma and discrimination.

At Advancing Analytics, we have created a series of neurodivergent characters for Dungeons & Dragons. Each character is uniquely designed to showcase the strengths and abilities associated with their specific neurodivergent traits.

These characters demonstrate that neurodiversity is not a weakness, but rather a source of strength and creativity. By celebrating and embracing these differences, we can create a more inclusive and diverse world.
