    Findabhair was born into a family of wizards, and from a young age, it was clear that he had a natural talent for magic. However, Findabhair also struggled with reading and writing, a condition that was later diagnosed as dyslexia. Despite this, Findabhair was determined to follow in the footsteps of his family and become a wizard.

    Growing up, Findabhair found that traditional forms of learning, such as reading from spellbooks and writing incantations, were difficult for him. He often made mistakes and had trouble remembering the correct spell components. This led to frustration and feelings of inadequacy, especially when compared to his classmates who seemed to have no trouble with these tasks.

    However, Findabhair soon discovered that he had a unique talent - an innate understanding of magic that transcended the need for traditional forms of spellcasting. Instead of relying on written incantations, Findabhair learned to channel magic through his memories and instincts, unlocking new and unpredictable forms of magic in the process.

    With time and practice, Findabhair honed his skills and became a powerful wizard in his own right. He also learned to embrace his dyslexia, seeing it as a source of strength and creativity rather than a weakness. Findabhair now travels the land, using his unconventional magic to help those in need and prove that dyslexia need not be an obstacle to greatness.

# About section
with st.container():
    st.header("What is Neurodiversity Celebration Week?")
    st.write("""
    Neurodiversity Celebration Week is an annual event that promotes awareness and acceptance of neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and Tourette's syndrome. This week-long celebration aims to highlight the unique strengths and abilities of neurodivergent individuals, while challenging stigma and discrimination.

    At Advancing Analytics, we have created a series of neurodivergent characters for Dungeons & Dragons. Each character is uniquely designed to showcase the strengths and abilities associated with their specific neurodivergent traits.

    These characters demonstrate that neurodiversity is not a weakness, but rather a source of strength and creativity. By celebrating and embracing these differences, we can create a more inclusive and diverse world.
