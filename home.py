    Neurodiversity Celebration Week is an annual event that promotes awareness and acceptance of neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and Tourette's syndrome. This week-long celebration aims to highlight the unique strengths and abilities of neurodivergent individuals, while challenging stigma and discrimination.

    At Advancing Analytics, we have created a series of neurodivergent characters for Dungeons & Dragons. Each character is uniquely designed to showcase the strengths and abilities associated with their specific neurodivergent traits.

    These characters demonstrate that neurodiversity is not a weakness, but rather a source of strength and creativity. By celebrating and embracing these differences, we can create a more inclusive and diverse world.
